 # Simple Operating System Project

Welcome to my simple operating system project!  
This is a learning project to understand how computers boot and how operating systems work at a very basic level.

## Overview

This project is a minimal operating system that:

- Boots using a custom bootloader written in Assembly.
- Loads and runs a small 16-bit kernel.
- Displays simple messages on the screen.
